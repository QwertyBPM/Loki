      <ol>
        <p>Before we begin it is essential for the eggs to be at room temperature. Make sure to seperate the clears from the yolk, to prevent a bad egg contaminating the rest.</p>
        <li>First, we will begin with our wet ingrediants, add the yolks with half of our sugar. Mix for 1 minute,  and slowly add the milk to the mix and stir swiftly for 3 minutes. </li>
        <li>Now we combine our dry ingrediants, Flour, salt, and baking powder. Gently add the dry ingredients to our wet inggrediants to avoid lumps in the batter.</li>
        <li>Stir slowly for 2 minutes till we get an even batter.</li>
		  <li>Beat the egg whites with the rest of our remaining sugar at high velocity. Then add the vanilla</li>
		  <li>Fold in the egg whites with the rest egg yolk mixture till fully mixed.</li>
		  <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F or 180&deg;C.</li>
		  <li>Bake for 40 or 45 minutes depending on the mold you are using. Avoid opening the open to prevent uneven cooking.</li>
		  <li>Once the timer is up you make enjoy your panetela or add coconut shavings, jam, or syrup for extra enjoyment. Enjoy. </li>
